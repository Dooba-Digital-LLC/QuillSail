"""Permissions, and working out which ones a person has.

As in MediaWiki, permissions belong to groups and people collect them by being
in groups. Everyone gets the permissions of the implicit "Everyone" group.
People with a confirmed account also get the "Members" permissions. Being in
"Administrators" grants every permission, so a site can never lock itself out.

Extensions can add permissions with ``register()``. They appear in the
dashboard's permission editor straight away.

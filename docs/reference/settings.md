# Dashboard settings

Administrators change these under **Dashboard → Settings**, and they're stored in the database, so they take effect without a restart. Settings marked as uploads, such as logos, are changed on the Appearance page. Extensions can add their own settings, which appear under **Extensions**. Keys are what templates and extensions read, for example `setting('site.name')`.

# Permissions and groups

Permissions belong to groups, and people collect them by joining groups. Everyone, including visitors who aren't signed in, gets the **Everyone** group's permissions. People with a confirmed account also get **Members**. Someone can grant or assign only the permissions they hold themselves. See [groups and permissions](../groups-and-permissions.md) for how to use them.

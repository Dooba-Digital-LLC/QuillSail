# Command line

Every command starts with `quillsail`. The older `copydesk` name still works as an alias. Commands that work on a publication find its configuration from `--config`, then the `COPYDESK_CONFIG` environment variable, then `./copydesk.toml`, then `/etc/copydesk/copydesk.toml`. Use `--instance NAME` instead for a named local publication.

This page covers the full command-line tool that comes with the Python package and server installations. The `quillsail` command added by the [terminal installer](../install-script.md) opens the desktop app instead.

Run `quillsail COMMAND --help` for the same details in your terminal.
